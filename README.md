# Quiz_Game_Project
 I have been learning Python for about one month now, and I wanted to put everything I learned into practice and see how far I can go on a real project starting from scratch.  The first project that I chose to do is this quiz game, where the player can decide which question category he/she wants to answer. It can be Geography, Animals, Music, Movies, or a mix of everything.  The game keeps running until the player finishes to answer all the questions. If the chosen option doesn't exist, the game will show a message and ask to try again.  After every question, the game will be present a message showing how many questions are missing and the actual score. The final score will appear at the end.
